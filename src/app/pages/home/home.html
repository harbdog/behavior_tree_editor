    <h3 class="header">Basic usage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drag nodes from the left sidebar, drag the node "handles" to connect nodes</li>
        <li>Press "a" to auto organize the tree</li>
        <li>Make new trees under "Project/New tree" or hover over "Trees" side bar divider</li>
        <li>You can drag the tree names just like other nodes to nest trees</li>
        <li>You must name one tree "Root" (the name of the tree is set via the title of the tree's root node)</li>
        <li>Shift+click to pan the view (or middle mouse button)</li>
        <li>Del key (fn+delete on a macbook) deletes a node</li>
        <li>Each node has details/instructions in its description</li>
        <li>Be sure to save via the menu icon or cntr+s or "Project/Save project"</li>
        <li>You can create custom action nodes via "Project/New node" or the Nodes sidebar divider. They should have a unique name, the "actions" category, and a title in the same format as the generic function action.</li>
        <li>Using "&lt;key_name&gt;" in a node's title will render the value for that property's key</li>
        <li>You can use "templates" in titles and properties to reference properties on the tree's root node.  Templates look like <span>{{key_name}</span>}.</li>
      </ul>
